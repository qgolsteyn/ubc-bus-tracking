# UBC Bus Tracking Web App

This app was developed when I moved out of university residence to a small home a couple of kilometers away from UBC Campus. While I could previously afford a lot of flexibility in my morning schedule (as I could just walk to class), this was just not possible anymore as I had to _take the bus_. I soon realize the difficulty of trying to adapt my schedule to that of TransLink's (Vancouver's public transit company): I didn't know when the bus was going to arrive at my stop.

The UBC Bus Tracking project stems from that dilemna. Instead of relying on Google Maps on my phone for getting bus information, this application allows me to have a monitor near the entrance of my house with constant bus schedule information.
